# ðŸ’» Hands-on Lab: Model Development Using Regression

**Estimated time to complete: 45 minutes**

This Jupyter-based lab helps you develop and evaluate various linear and polynomial regression models to predict laptop prices based on different features. The lab is designed for learners using **JupyterLite** or **local Jupyter environments**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Apply Single Variable Linear Regression
- Apply Multiple Variable Linear Regression
- Fit Polynomial Regression models (1st, 3rd, and 5th degree)
- Create and use a regression pipeline with scaling and polynomial features
- Evaluate models using **RÂ² score** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

---

## ðŸ§° Libraries Used

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/)
- [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/)

> Note: In **JupyterLite**, you may need to run this before importing seaborn:
```python
import piplite
await piplite.install('seaborn')
